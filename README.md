### ðŸ“˜ Overview

MaNGO introduces a **Meta Neural Graph Operator** that enables **Graph Network Simulators** to adapt across different physical systems.  
The method combines **meta-learning** with a **neural operator based architecture**, allowing the simulator to generalize to unseen material properties and predict full trajectories efficiently and stably.

### ðŸš€ Code Release

The code will be released soon.  
Stay tuned for updates once the camera-ready version is finalized.
